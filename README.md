# Forest Fire Predictor 🌲🔥

**An AI-powered tool to predict forest fire risk based on environmental variables using Python and machine learning.**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to forecast the likelihood of forest fires by analyzing environmental parameters—such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall—through a machine learning model trained on historical wildfire data.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔹 Ingests environmental data (CSV, JSON, etc.)  
- 🔹 Preprocesses and engineers features for model readiness  
- 🔹 Trains ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for classification/regression  
- 🔹 Evaluates model performance with metrics like accuracy, F1 score  
- 🔹 Allows prediction with new input data  
- 🔹 Designed for future extension with Streamlit or Flask frontend

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrinceGupta8/Forest-Fire-Predictor.git
cd Forest-Fire-Predictor
````

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Prepare dataset

* Place your dataset file(s) in the `data/` folder.
* Update preprocessing paths in `train_model.py` if needed.

## ▶️ Training the Model

Run the training script:

```bash
python src/train_model.py \
  --input data/forest_fire_data.csv \
  --output models/fire_predictor.pkl
```

This trains the model and saves it to `models/fire_predictor.pkl`.

---

## ▶️ Making Predictions

Use the trained model to predict with new data:

```bash
python src/predict.py \
  --model models/fire_predictor.pkl \
  --input data/new_env_data.csv \
  --output results/predictions.csv
```

Outputs prediction results with risk classifications and probabilities.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

* Produces classification metrics and confusion matrix
* Generates feature importance plot to interpret key variables
* Notebooks available in `notebooks/` for EDA and evaluation analysis

---

## ✅ Future Roadmap

* [ ] Integration with Streamlit or Flask for interactive UI
* [ ] Add support for real-time data ingestion (e.g., APIs, sensors)
* [ ] Implement advanced models: XGBoost, LightGBM, Deep Learning
* [ ] Include geospatial visualization (e.g., risk heatmaps)
* [ ] Containerize with Docker for seamless deployment
